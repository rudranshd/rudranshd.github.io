          <p>Howdy! I am currently a third semester Computer Science student at Texas A&M University looking for a Software Engineering Internship for the summer of 2021. I have extensive experience with C++ and Python, having previously conducted scientific data analysis using the libraries Pandas, Numpy, and SciPy. My greatest strengths are working well under stress, communicating effectively, and learning new things. </p>
